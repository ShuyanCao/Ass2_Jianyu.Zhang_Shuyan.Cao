        "* In general, recommender system is a system that can provide the most relevant information for users by discovering patterns in users’ data, and algorithms are used to calculate the recommended items. Through the recommendation engine, users in the system will be benefited by the recommendations of items, which make users not suffer from the massive information. The most famous example about recommender system is Amazon, it gives some recommendations on items for customers based on their browsing history. There are still some other examples such as YouTube and Spotify, they will recommend some videos and music to users. Recommender system generally use either contend based filtering or collaborative filtering, or both of them. In this report, we will use content based and collaborative algorithms to analyse the movie dataset to provide some recommendations of movies based on user’ s search result and users’ preferences. The report will introduce how to build the movie recommender system and how does the algorithms work. By the end of this report, a comparative study of the two approaches will be provided. \n",

Due to the process objects are different, it is difficult to find a dataset contain both items ‘features and users’ interests. The possible solution apply in this report is to implement collaborative filtering and content based on different datasets. \n",

        "\n",
        "##2) Data Structure(content-based): \n",
        "* To build the qualified recommendation system, it is necessary to select and confirm the features of the datasets. In general, actors, director, genre, and story could be the features or tags to describe a movie. Therefore, in this dataset, we will use columns of genre, crew, cast, keywords as our features first and add some other features later on. Firstly, we need to extract the top 3 members of the cast(actors), the director from the crew, and most 5 related keywords about the movie from the datasets. When these general features are extracted from the datasets, it is necessary to consider to include some additional features into the model. And we add the input of overview from the dataset, which represent the summary of the story of the movie. After we define all the features, we need to build a model called tag package in python to include all the necessary features. This the final and most important step in designing the data structure.  When tag package is built, the new frame of dataset will be shown as the following figure.\n",

        "* In this part, the main algorithms implemented here is the cosine similarity matrix. Cosine similarity is a common approach to determine the similarity of the documents based on counting the maximum number of same words in both documents. In terms of mathematics, cosine similarity calculates the cosine of the angle between two vectors in a multidimensional space. In this project, the two vectors are the arrays containing words according to the features defined in the dataset. When we plot multidimensional space, the cosine similarity captures the documents’ angles. \n",

        "###b) Build and Train Models\n",
        "* To build the model, we will use the CountVectorizer from scikit-learn package. Within this function, the keywords from the datasets related to features of movie will be selected and the frequency of each word will be counted in the matrix. After this process is completed, we do the main step which is creating matrix by applying the cosine similarity.  Then, list of indices will be created for the match of movie recommendations. Finally, after all the preparation work is completed, it will be the last step to build the real recommendation function for movies. In the recommendation function, the matching movie will be retrieved firstly. Then, cosine similarity scores will be in descending order. The last step in the function is that the display of the recommendation result of most similar movies.\n",

Based on the evaluation of each movie by different users, the score value of the movie not watched by users was calculated and predicted. Like in Figure.1, although there are abundant of blank cell, system will collect the excited rate from each user ID to calculate the similarity then fill the blank cell. \n",

Essentially it is just a movie that recommends a movie, it can't find different movie types that users might be interested in. Different users will get the same recommendation when they input the same movie. Equally importantly, because the algorithm did not filter the data, it is not difficult to see that 328 and 283 movies exceeded the standards which should between 0 to 5.\n",

In this practical model, we apply this approach about the dataset selection. Although, the more data collected will benefit the data analytics more to obtain a better or more accurate result of analytics especially for the recommender system, some laws we must obey even know breaking the law or ethics will have a better analytics outcome. In our data selection, we first concern the source of the dataset, the data source must be chosen from a public resource and the theft of the private resources must be prohibited, as well as accepting some suspected resources. So, we choose our data from Kaggle which is the public website for sharing data. On the other hand, we also concern about the content of the dataset, the content of the dataset must not invasion of customers’ privacy. Some information as customers’ credit card number, or passport number cannot be contained in the dataset. Furthermore, if such kind of privacy information contained in the dataset, it is responsible for all data users to report this probl\n",

And collaborative filtering approach is more suitable for users are more concern about movie’s rating or quality.\n",
